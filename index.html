        <h1>About me</h1> 
        <p>
            My name is Evellin Miyamoto, 30 years old, I'm from Brazil and have been living in <a href="index2.html" class="link">Jönköping</a> for 18 months. I'm married and moved to Sweden following my husband’s career. In Brazil I’m Occupational Therapist, but here in Sweden I decided to change career and try something new.

         <h3>Why New Media Design?</h3>
    <p>
        My interest in technology started long time ago, when I enjoyed playing games in my 
        computer and building different styles of blogs and websites on the deprecated BlogSpot, now 
        Blogger, and basic WordPress forums in the early 2000s. Even though I've studied and worked 
        in another area that also inspired me, in the last years this aspiration for the technological 
        sphere reborn in me, and now, I am looking forward to working in this area.
        I did my bachelor's and postgraduate in Occupational Therapy, therefore, I have experience 
        working in hospitals and rehabilitation centres. In this profession we were used to several 
        unique tools to aid in the rehabilitation process, one in special is called Assistive Technology, 
        which is the use of devices to adapt or promote independence in the daily life of persons with 
        disability, cognitive or physical. The use of software for accessibility in a functional and 
        interesting design always caught my attention because of this complexity and relevance for 
        quality of life in this context and this was another important aspect that made me choose these new career.
